# BashBot
_a bot that lets you access your server from telegram_

**DISCLAIMER**

This is still a very early version, it's basically just a proof of concept at this point

# How to setup
* clone the repository
* duplicate the config_template.json file and call it config.json
* fill in all the required fields in config.json (the whitelist isn't required)

_the whitelist, if not left empty, should be an array of Telegram User IDs_
